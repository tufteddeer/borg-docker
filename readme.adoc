Alpine based docker container that comes with borg and a script to backup docker volumes.

The directories to backup are hardcoded in the backup script at this point.

docker-compose.yml contains an example setup to backup a Nextcloud installation along with its database

== How to

=== Building


[source, shell]
----
docker build -t borgbackup .
----

=== Manual backup

This creates a new instance that mounts all volumes from nextcloud_db_1 and _app_1 and runs the backup script.

[source, shell]
----
docker run --rm --name borg_instance --volumes-from nextcloud_db_1 --volumes-from nextcloud_app_1 -v ~/backup:/backup -it borgbackup sh -c "BORG_REPO=/backup/borgrepo /etc/periodic/daily/backup"
----

The BORG_REPO environment variable as well as the container arguments to volumes-from have to be set accordingly. (The script file as well if it is stored in some other place)

If there already is a running instance, `docker exec` might be used as well.
